# Cyber and Fraud Centre Scotland - Testing Laptop / Testing VM Playbook

This ansible playbook was created with the original purpose of reworking the
Testing Laptop used by Cyber and Fraud Centre Scotland. However, it has now became
a streamlined way for the hackers to spin up a completely fresh Kali Linux VM for
each engagement, ensuring that there are no overlaps in data between tests and clients.
